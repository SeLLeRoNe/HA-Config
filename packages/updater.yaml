# The updater component will check daily for new releases.
# It will show a badge in the frontend if a new version is found.
# As Hass.io has its own schedule for release it doesn’t make sense
# to use this component on Hass.io. Nevertheless, I'm still including it,
# since I like to know something is upcoming :)
